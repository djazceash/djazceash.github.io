<h1>The prayer below was found on a wall in the Pediatric Intensive<br />
Care Unit (PICU) during Alex's first days at Duke Hospital.<br />
Throughout his stay we found comfort each time it was read...</h1>
<br />


<h2>A Parents Prayer</h2>
<p>
I'll lend you for a little time, a child of mine, He said.<br>
For you to Love while he lives, and mourn when he is dead.<br>
It may be six or seven years, or twenty two or three,<br>
But will you, till I call him back, take care of him for me?<br>
He'll bring his charms to gladden you, and shall his stay be brief,<br>
You'll have his lovely memories as solace for your grief.<br>
I cannot promise he will stay, since all from earth return,<br>
But there are lessons taught down there I want this child to learn.<br>
I've looked the wide world over, in my search for teachers true,<br>
and from the throngs that crowd life's lanes, I have selected you.<br>
Now will you give him all your Love, nor think the labor vain,<br>
Nor hate me when I come to call, to take him back again?<br>
I fancied that I heard them say,<br>
<br>
Dear Lord, thy will be done,<br>
For all the joy thy child shall bring,<br>
The risk of grief we'll run.<br>
We'll shelter him with tenderness,<br>
We'll Love him while we may,<br>
And for the happiness we've known,<br>
Will ever grateful stay.<br>
But shall the angels call for him,<br>
Much sooner than we planned,<br>
We'll brave the bitter grief that comes,<br>
And try to understand.<br>
</p>

</center>
