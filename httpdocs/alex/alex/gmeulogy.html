<b>Grandma Carman:</b>
<center>My Grandson, so young and so powerful,<br>
He brought us together in tears and laughter.<br>
He showed us how when the going got rough,<br>
Fight, Don't give up.<br>
Everybody that met Alex, Loved him,<br>
And I think Alex knew it.<br>
He seemed very wise to me.<br>
I can't hold him in my arms,<br>
So I'll hold him in my heart.<br>
Yes, I do believe in angels,<br>
And our Alex is our very special Angel.<br>
Love you very much, Mister...<br>
Granny.</center>

<b>Grandma Eash:</b>
<center>Alex was the sweetest grandson,<br>
baby boy, anyone could ever have.<br>
He could look at you and make you<br>
so happy, and so sad.<br>
His warmth and innocents came bubbling<br>
out at all times.  I am so happy that <br>
God has shared this wonderful little <br>
with us, even for a short time.<br>
I would not have given up the Joy<br>
and Love that I felt being Grandmother<br>
to the dearest little fellow in the World.</center>
