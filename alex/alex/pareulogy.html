Below are the thoughts and memories of Alex that Janine and I shared...
<br>

<U><B>David:</B></U><BR>
	Alex was Gods most generous gift to us.  God gave him to us to allow us to Love as
we never loved before, and to understand the power of the lives of the little children.
<BR>

<U><B>Janine:</B></U><BR>
	Alex endured more in his short time here than any of us could in two lifetimes.  We 
only pray that we can be half as strong as he was.
<BR>

<U><B>David:</B></U><BR>	
	Alex showed us the true meaning of Life, Love, Gods gifts, Family, and Strength.
<BR>

<U><B>Janine:</B></U><BR>
	Alex taught us all that we should be ever thankful of what we have.  That we should 
cherish each day that we are given, as each day is truly a gift.
<BR>

<U><B>David:</B></U><BR>
	Alex showed us that every bad day also contains a lesson learned, a reason to fight on,
and always... that silver lining.
<BR>

<U><B>Janine:</B></U><BR>
	At times we would sit and hold him for hours in wonder and amazement.  Wondering how we
could be so blessed to have a child as perfect as Alex.  Wondering how Alex could have such an
amazing ability to pull through his challenges and still make us laugh and feel good.  Wondering
how we deserved this much joy and happiness... and at the same time, this much pain and sorrow.
<BR>

<U><B>David:</B></U><BR>
	We often wondered, also, if he knew and understood what was going on.  Anyone who knew
Alex, knows that he did.  Alex had the gift of being able to let us know when he was happy, when
he was sad, when he was in pain and finally, when he was too tired to go on.  His big beautiful
eyes had such a way of showing what he wanted to tell us.  We never wondered how he was feeling,
and what needed to be done for him.  He knew he was not here to stay for long, and showed us
that this fragile thing called Life, should never be taken for granted.
<BR>

<U><B>Janine:</B></U><BR>
	Alex was the STRONGEST, the most LOVING, the most JOYFUL, the SWEETEST, the most
GORGEOUS, the most PRECIOUS, and the most PERFECT “Little Man” ever to grace our presence.
 He truly was not an infant, as he had the will, the strength, and the determination of any man.
<BR>

<U><B>David:</B></U><BR>
	Alex, we Love you and we miss you more than words alone can say.  We know, however, that
you WILL be in our hearts forever...
