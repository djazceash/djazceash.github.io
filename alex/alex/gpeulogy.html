<center>My Alexander the Great<br>
Aug. 6, 1996 ... Nov. 27th, 1996<br>
<br>
Dear Family and Friends...<br>
<br>
I believe True Love is a power, of fragile,<br>
yet lasting beauty...<br>
With our nurturing care, forgetting the I,<br>
It will be there to pass to the future...<br>
I know this to be true, for I have seen...<br>
Love flow unto all around, <br>
Alex's Radiance Beamed...<br>
The future, we know not for how long,<br>
it may be only the length of a song.<br>
The Lessons and Strengths Alex gave me<br>
throughout his breif life's fight,<br>
Will indeed last me, the rest of my life...<br>
With a Warrior's Heart,<br>
He conquered my world in just 114 days.<br>
Alex will live on in my heart...<br>
My....Alexander the Great!!!</center>

<b>Grandpa Eash:</b>
<center>To Alex (I Love You, Man!)<br>
<br>
Your eyes and face have showed me Love,<br>
I know you were sent from God above,<br>
I loved that sweet and wonderful smile,<br>
Although we had it for just a while.<br>
You made my life worthwhile and complete,<br>
Alex, you were very stong, and sweet.<br>
You favored your father and mother,<br>
When I looked at you I exclaimed, Oh brother!<br>
We enjoyed to very much for 114 days,<br>
Your life changed mine in many ways.<br>
You were so strong and never gave up.<br>
When I get to Heaven, I want to drink from the same cup.<br>
I know you are up with God right now,<br>
You showed Gods creation, and how!<br>
Physically you are much better off than we,<br>
It will be in Heaven that we shall see.<br>
So, Thank you much,<br>
Precious Alex, Grandson,<br>
When we get there, we'll all be one.</center>
