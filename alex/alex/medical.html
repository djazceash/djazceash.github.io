<h3><u><center>Alex's Medical Procedures:</center></u></h3>
<OL>
<LI>Heart Surgery:
	<UL>
	<LI>Aorta-Pulmonary Shunt Operation, 8/9/96
		<UL>
		<LI>Surgery to add a 4mm Gortex shunt connecting systemic artery to the pulmonary artery to allow blood to flow to the lungs.
		<LI>Surgeons: Dr. Ross Ungerleider, Dr. James Jaggers
		<LI>Cardiologists: Dr. Bengur, Dr. Womack, Dr. Li, Dr. Herlong
		</UL>
	<LI>Glen Shunt Operation, 11/12/96
		<UL>
		<LI>Otherwise known as the &quot;Hemi-Fontan&quot;, as it is the first half of the entire Fontan Procedure.
		<LI>Surgery would connect the Superior Vena Cava (SVC), which carries blood from the upper body, to the pulmonary arteries to 
		allow direct blood flow to the lungs.
		<LI>This physiology depends on the blood flowing on it's own as there is no way to make the blood flow without a Left Ventricle.
		<LI>Had been planned for Jan '97, however, other circumstances caused this to be moved to November '96.
		<LI>After making the connections, there was a problem with getting enough blood to flow properly to the lungs.  Thus additional 
		surgery would be required.
		<LI>Surgeons: Dr. James Jaggers, Dr. Ross Ungerleider
		<LI>Cardiologists: Dr. Martin O'Laughlin, Dr. Li
		</UL>
	<LI>Glen Shunt Operation, 11/18/96
		<UL>
		<LI>Surgery to attempt to increase the size of the SVC and the pulmonary arteries to allow more blood flow.
		<LI>After again trying to achieve adequate blood flow, it still was not working properly.
		<LI>Surgeons: Dr. James Jaggers, Dr. Ross Ungerleider
		<LI>Cardiologists: Dr. Martin O'Laughlin
		</UL>
	<LI>Stent Placement, 11/22/96
		<UL>
		<LI>Surgery to place stents into the SVC and the PA's.
		<LI>Surgery performed in the operating room.
		<LI>Placed three stents:
			<UL><LI>One 18mm stent in lower end of SVC at the PA
			<LI>Two 18mm stents in right PA, overlapped slightly.
			<LI>None placed in left PA, due to short length of left PA and what seemed to be adequate blood flow to the left already.
			</UL>
		<LI>After surgery was completed, again insufficient results.
		<LI>Surgeon: Dr. James Jaggers.
		<LI>Cardiologist: Dr. Martin O'Laughlin
		</UL>
	<LI>Stent Placement, 11/26/96
		<UL>
		<LI>Surgery to place stent into left PA only.
		<LI>Surgery performed in PICU directly.
		<LI>Placed one 18mm stent into left PA
		<LI>After surgery was completed, again insufficient results.
		<LI>This would be the final procedure to try to repair the problems.
		<LI>Upon this procedure not producing the results needed, the decision was made to remove Alex from ECMO and allow him to finally rest.
		<LI>Surgeon: Dr. James Jaggers
		<LI>Cardiologist: Dr. Martin O'Laughlin
		</UL>
	<LI>Fontan Procedure
		<UL>
		<LI>Proposed Final heart surgery.  Second half of Fontan Operation.
		<LI>Was to be planned for 18 months to 3 years of age.
		</UL>
	</UL>

<LI>Other Surgeries or Procedures:
	<UL>
	<LI>Placate  non-functioning right diaphram. 11/12/96
		<UL>
		<LI>Surgery to &quot;tack down&quot; the right diaphram as it was not moving properly.
		<LI>Was performed during first Glenn Shunt Surgery.
		<LI>Surgeon: Dr. James Jaggers.
		</UL>
	<LI>&quot;Tack down&quot; Intestines due to Non-Rotation
		<UL>
		<LI>Not done.
		</UL>
	</UL>
