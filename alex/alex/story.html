<H2>November 1996</H2>
<p>
<DT><strong>Tue Nov 12th</strong>
<DD>After being unable to determine the cause of the intermittent fevers and other mysterious 
problems, the
doctors determined that we should move Alex's second surgery (Glenn Shunt (Hemi-Fontan)) from 
January '97 to now.
The surgery began today at around 8am.  The first hour or two of the surgery was to placate his right 
diaphram, to 
allow the lungs to expand fully.  They then began the shunt procedure.  The surgery was very 
complicated and lasted 
much longer than expected.  There were many problems with taking him off of the operating room 
by-pass machine.  After
several attempts, he was able to come back to PICU.  Once in PICU, other complications arose and 
his heart stopped for a 
moment.  After reviving him, they made the determination to place him on ECMO (Heart/Lung by-
pass machine).  The cause of 
the difficulties is not yet known.

<DT><strong>Mon Nov 18th</strong>
<DD>A Heart Cath. was done today and showed that the problems in the previous surgery was due 
to a narrowing in the SVC. The
 surgeons determined that it was something which they could repair and prepared him for surgery 
that afternoon.  This surgery
 began at around 6:30pm today.  This procedure again was very difficult.  Alex again had problems 
with coming off of the by-pass 
machine.  The surgeons tried several times to fix the narrowing, however, even after repairing things 
still were not working properly. 
Alex was again brought back to PICU on the ECMO machine.  Again exact cause, unknown.

<DT><strong>Tue Nov 19th</strong>
<DD>An Angiogram was done today and found that the SVC and both PA's were collapsing due to 
lack of venus pressure, compression from the 
patches and sutures from the previous surgeries, and from the aorta twisting and lying on those 
vessels.  The surgeons determined that the 
next step should be to add stents into the SVC and each of the PA's (three total stents).  This should 
allow the vessels to remain open and 
allow the blood to flow freely into the lungs.  This procedure is still very new, and is high risk due to 
the fresh patches and sutures which 
the stents could tear apart.  The procedure was set up for the operating room rather than the cath 
lab, and scheduled for early this Friday, the
22nd.

<DT><strong>Fri Nov 22nd</strong>
<DD>Alex was again taken to the operating room to have the stents placed.  The doctor's decided 
to place a stent at the bottom of the SVC, and two in the right PA.   The length and placement of the 
left PA make it difficult to place a stent in the left side, also current angiograms showed blood flowing 
in the left.  The operation went by with no complications and the stents seem to be doing what was 
expected.  We will need to wait, however, to see if the blood will flow through now that they are 
open.

<DT><strong>Mon Nov 25th</strong>
<DD>We tried to cycle Alex off of the ECMO machine, he his own down to about half flow (machine 
doing about half of the work for him), however, when the machine was clamped off to allow Alex to 
do it all on his own, his oxygenation numbers dropped very quickly to an unacceptable level.   We 
had to again return to ECMO for life support.  The doctors decided to keep the respirator at full 
volume, and add Nitric Oxide for 12 hours to assist the lungs with recovery.

<DT><strong>Tue Nov 26th</strong>
<DD>We tried again today to remove Alex from the ECMO, the results were slightly better than 
yesterday, however, was still way below acceptable.   We stopped the Nitric Oxide for now, but will 
turn it on again about 12 hours before our next attempt at cycling him off ECMO.  The doctor's all 
agreed that he reacted somewhat better, but, the possibility of the blood just not flowing to the lungs 
was getting even more real.

<DT><strong>Wed Nov 27th</strong>
<DD><B>10:00am:</B>  We decided to slowly begin cycling down the ECMO machine, the flow (or 
the 
amount of assistance the machine was giving) would be turned down slightly every 15min until it was 
at half flow.  After a few minutes, the surgeon decided it would probably be beneficial to take 
another angiogram to make sure that the blood was flowing to the lungs before any attempt to cycle 
down was made.<br>
<B>11:00am:</B>  The surgeon and cardiologist did an angiogram.  We shot a picture while still on 
ECMO 
and then one with ECMO clamped off.  It would be a while till we knew what we would see, so the 
ECMO was again turned to full flow.<br>
<B>12:00pm:</B>  The surgeon came to us and showed us the pictures from the angiogram.  The 
showed a 
very obvious problem.  There was NO blood flow to the left now.  This was very odd due to the 
earlier pictures which showed what seemed to be sufficient flow to the left.   It was obvious that 
there was no way that Alex could live with this occuring.  The decision was made to have the 
surgeon and a cardiologist place another stent, this time in the left side.  They set it up to be done 
this time right in the PICU bed rather than transferring to the operating room again.  We did not want 
to move him that much again.  It was scheduled for 2pm.<br>
<B>2:00pm: </B> After sitting with Alex for the past couple of hours, it was finally time to try the 
additional 
stent.  The surgeon and the operating room technicians and equipment had arrived and it was time 
to leave.  I had a little talk with Alex and I told him that I was very proud of him for all that he has 
done.  I asked him to be strong for just a while longer, that we would try this and that it would then 
be up to him.  He would need to tell us then, what should be done.<br>
<B>3:30pm:</B>  We all sat anxiously and felt a great deal discouragement, although we still had a 
glimmer 
of hope to hold on to...<br>
The surgeon came out and asked to speak with us privately.  We knew right away that it was not 
going to be great news.  The stent was placed on the left side without any problems, they went 
ahead and shot another angiogram, which showed no improvement.   While the operating room and 
all the doctors were present they had decided to again try to cycle down from the ECMO.  The 
results again were very bad.   We were now faced with two clear facts; the blood simply was not 
flowing to the lungs and the surgeons have done all that can be done.  A decision had to be made.  
We asked the surgeon to clean up Alex and his bed space from the surgery and allow us some time 
alone with him.  We knew then that this would be the last time we would have the chance to visit 
with him.<br>
<B>4:30pm:</B>  We were finally able to go and visit with him, it was by far the most difficult part of 
this 
whole time to this point.  We sat with him, we touched him, we prayed with him, and we cried with 
him.  I again had a talk with him, and although he was as sedated as he was, I still feel that he knew 
what was going on.  I asked him what we should do... As I talked with him, I noticed that his eyes 
had opened ever so slightly, and a tear came out of the corner of his left eye, then he slowly closed 
his eye again.  He looked so tired and it was obvious that everything that could be done was done.  
Alex had fought as much as he could fight, and Janine and I had to ask that Alex be removed from 
the ECMO and allowed to rest finally.<br>
<B>5:15pm:</B>   We asked the doctors to take care of removing all of the equipment and once 
that was 
done, to allow us to come in and hold him one last time.   We understood that he would pass on just 
moments after being removed from the equipment, and that this was the last time we would be with 
him while he was still alive.<br>
<B>5:30pm:</B>   We were called back in to PICU where they had opened a separate room to 
allow Janine 
and I privacy to sit with and hold Alex.  There are no words to describe our feelings while with him 
during this time.  He looked so peaceful and although we were heartbroken that he was now gone, 
we found comfort in the fact that he was now able to rest, and was in a much better place.  We sat 
with him in our arms for several minutes, then as we could not stand our own pain any longer, we 
left.<br>
<B>6:00pm:</B>  After talking and crying with all of the doctors and nurses who had been such a 
part of our 
lives for the last four months, we left the hospital.  We did not have any idea, nor did we want to 
think about, "What Now?"....
