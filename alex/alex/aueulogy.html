<center>All I know is Alex <i>Has</i> my heart, not <i>Had</i>,<br>
Has, and always will.<br>
He gathered a family of blood and friends<br>
Together for always,<br>
A common bond...Alex.<br>
I held him on my birthday,<br>
and for always will hold him,<br>
In my heart.<br></center>

<b>Aunt Kristine</b>
<center>Alex taught me to never give up,<br>
No matter how tough what you are going through,<br>
Never give up.<br>
Alex taught us to enjoy the simple things in life like:<br>
</center>
<ul><ul>
<LI>The sun hitting you in your face, as you take a stroll
<LI>A good pacifier
<li>Airplanes in the sky
<li>A good day in a swing
<li>Or just laying around gazing up towards the ceiling.
</ul></ul>

<b>Aunt Melissa</b>
<center>Alex was an Angel in my eyes.<br>
He was exceptionally special because he was a<br>
gift to David and Janine.<br>
Just as a child would be a special gift to Gary<br>
and I because we can't have children,<br>
David and Janine had tried for a while,<br>
Alex was truly a blessing from God,<br>
especially when you try a while it makes<br>
it even more precious.</center>

<b>Aunt Marcie</b>
<center>Alexander M. Eash<br>
In your quiet presence that was so brief,<br>
you touched each heart that knew you,<br>
and those who didn't.<br>
Those who are Loved are never lost,<br>
but Loved eternally.<br>
We Love you Alex.</center>
