<h1>Necrotizing Enterocolitis</h1>
<center><IMG SRC="../images/bar.gif"></center>

<h2>What is necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)?</h2>

"Necrotizing" means causing death to tissue, "entero" refers to the small intestine, "colo" refers to large intestine, "itis" is inflammation. Necrotizing enterocolitis is an inflammation causing destruction of part of the bowel. NEC may involve only the innermost lining or the entire thickness of the bowel and variable amounts of the bowel.
<p>
<h2>Why do premature babies get NEC?</h2>
 
Premature infants have immature and fragile bowels. They are sensitive to changes in blood flow and to infection. We often do not know why an individual baby develops NEC.
<p>
<h2>Did my breast milk cause NEC?</h2>

No, breast milk neither causes NEC nor prevents a baby from developing it.
<p>
<h2>Is NEC serious?</h2>
 
Yes, baby's can lose some of their bowel from it. Some babies die of NEC. For this reason doctors may start treatment on simply the suspicion that your baby might be developing symptoms of NEC. This suspicion is sometimes referred to as "rule out NEC", "possible NEC" or a "NEC scare".
<p>
<h2>How will my baby act if s/he has NEC?</h2>
 
Your baby may show any or all of the following:
<p>
<ul>
 <li>general signs of being "sick": less active, more apnea, increased respiratory problems, difficulty keeping his/her body temperature normal
<p>
 <li>poor tolerance to feedings, vomiting or not putting through the milk placed in the stomach (called aspirates or residuals). These may be greenish in color
<p>
 <li>increased size of the tummy
<p>
 <li>redness or abnormal color to the tummy
<p>
 <li>blood in the stool
</ul>
<p>
<h2>What can be done for it?</h2>
 
If your baby's doctor thinks that s/he might be developing NEC any or all of the following might be done.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>All regular feedings stopped. This is called NPO. The baby will have an IV started so s/he can be fed by vein.
<p>
 <li>A tube placed into the stomach either from the mouth or nose. The tube remove air and fluids from the baby's stomach and intestine. 
<p>
 <li>The tummy size measured with a tape measure and watched carefully
<p>
 <li>X-rays of the tummy 
<p>
 <li>A sample of the blood sent to the laboratory to see if it contains bacteria 
<p>
 <li>Antibiotics started
<p>
 <li>More frequent blood tests to look for signs of infection and imbalances in the body's chemistry
</ul>
<p>
<h2>What happens if part on my baby's intestine dies?</h2>

If only the innermost lining of bowel dies, the body can slowly regrow it. If the entire thickness of a piece of the bowel dies, the baby will need surgery to remove that piece of the bowel. The end of the bowel above the removed segment may be brought to the surface of the skin (called ostomy). At some later time, after the baby has recovered and grown much bigger, the two ends of the bowel can be sewn back together again. 
<p>
<h2>Are there any long term problems from NEC?</h2>

Most babies completely recover from NEC without further problems; but, future problems are possible. These include scarring and narrowing of the bowel causing "obstruction" of the bowel contents, and inability of the bowel to absorb nutrients normally, called "malabsorption".
