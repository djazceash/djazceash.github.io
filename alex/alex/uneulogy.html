The thoughts and memories of Alex's Uncles:
<br>
<br>

<b>Uncle Mike</b><br>
<center>A small part has died, but such a big part will live.
<p>Wonderment in his eyes...</p>
<p>Why ???</p>
<p>Proud, so Very Proud...</p>
<p>My Nephew</p>
<p>All our Baby Angel</p>
</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Uncle Jon</b><br>
<center>Alex has left in me a very special lesson.<br>
In watching him from the day he was born,<br>
This little boy had only one goal in mind,<br>
To Live.<br>
Alex has made me realize just how much in my own life I have overlooked.<br>
We all get so overwhelmed in the details and specifics of our lives that<br>
we miss what this little boy was showing us is the most precious detail of all<br>
Just Living.<br>
To appreciate life in it's most basic form,<br>
To enjoy being alive, being able to Love and to be Loved,<br>
Forsaking all the details that cloud that vision,<br>
I have for too long missed...<br>
That is what Alex will forever mean in my life.<br>
<br>
Thank you Alex.  May god hold you forever in his arms.</center>
